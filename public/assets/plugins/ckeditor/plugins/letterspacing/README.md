# Letter-spacing for CKEditor 4
#### By [Ã†ndrew Rininsland](http://www.twitter.com/aendrew) / [Times Digital Development](http://timesdigitaldevelopment.tumblr.com)

This is an ultra-simple plugin for CKEditor 4 that enables users to set the
letter-spacing CSS property on text -- or "tracking", as it's known in the
typographic and publishing worlds.

### To use:

1. Copy plugin.js to `ckeditor/plugins/letterspacing`
2. Add it to your config.js: `config.extraPlugins = 'letterspacing';`
3. If using custom toolbars, the item name is simply `letterspacing`.

### Roadmap:

* Possibly more units.
* Might replace the RichCombo with simply a text field.
* Have an idea? Feel free to add it to the project's [issue queue](https://github.com/times/ckeditor-letterspacing/issues).
